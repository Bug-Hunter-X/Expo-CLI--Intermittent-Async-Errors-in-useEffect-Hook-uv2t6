While developing a React Native application using Expo CLI, I encountered a peculiar error related to asynchronous operations and state updates within a functional component.  The error manifested inconsistently, sometimes working as expected and other times failing silently, without throwing an explicit error. This made debugging incredibly challenging. The issue seemed to stem from the way async functions were handled within useEffect hooks and how state updates were triggered within those functions.
