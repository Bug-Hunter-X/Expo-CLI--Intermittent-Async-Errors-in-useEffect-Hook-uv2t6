# Expo CLI: Intermittent Async Errors in useEffect Hook

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered while working with asynchronous operations within `useEffect` hooks in a React Native application built using Expo CLI. The bug manifests inconsistently, making debugging difficult.

## Bug Description
The application uses asynchronous functions within `useEffect` to fetch data.  Sometimes, this works perfectly; other times, the state fails to update, causing no error message or indication that anything went wrong. This erratic behavior makes identifying the root cause challenging.

## Bug Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Observe the inconsistent behavior of the data displayed (or lack thereof). 

## Solution
The provided solution includes changes designed to handle the async operation more robustly by including better error handling and explicit state update mechanisms that prevent unpredictable behavior.
